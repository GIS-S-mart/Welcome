# Open Science Benchmarking for Engineering Research

This open science wiki site is a collaborative space that gathers engineering methods and tools resulting from research studies to be benchmarked for providing objective evidences that the community is making progress.

## Motivations

*Why did we start this open science environement for benchmarking engineering research?*


for building confidence in the usefulness of the new knowledge with respect to a purpose

 regrouping empirical data bases, qualitative and quantitative standardized measures for comparing studies, and agreed upon theoretical constructs such as causal graphs 

# Goals

*What does this project provide?*

This open science project has been born and developed in order to make a move for the engineering research community progress.

## Data organisation

This open science environement is organised into several repositories.
- [Welcome - The ](https://github.com/GIS-S-mart/Welcome)
- [Discussions on Benchmark 1 - Model-Based Systems Engineering for Validation and Verification](https://github.com/GIS-S-mart/Benchmark-1_Model-Based_Systems_Engineering_for_Validation_and_Verification)

## Joining the community 

If you have any questions or run into problems during your benchmarking, please search for answers and/or reach out on **Discussions**:
