# Benchmarks in Industrial Engineering Research 

We observe that after several decades of developments, engineering research has come very far. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement. However, such improvements must be well documented and fairly evaluated. Time is over for making claims like “... results seem to be better from existing ones from the literature ...” or “... results cannot be validated because it requires an industrial partnership and more time".... It is authors’ responsibility to make quantitative judgements and fair comparisons to the state of the art.

This version-controlled and community-based open platform is a collaborative space gathering benchmarks of engineering theories, processes, methods and tools that intend to provide objective evidence.

## Motivations

*Why did we start this open science environment for benchmarking engineering research?*

During the last decades, our community of researchers in engineering design has reached a general consensus:

<blockquote> "As foundation of good scientific practise, manuscripts submitted for publication must advance the state of the art and provide novel theoretical, numerical or mechanical insight and knowledge. Sometimes, good ideas turn out to be not as good as initially expected, i.e., the initial research hypotheses or promises turn out not to hold. This is no shame and in fact learning from other researches’ mistakes or failed attempts may be just as fruitful as learning from successes and may save a lot of time. Unfortunately, however, many manuscripts set out with high goals and claims but fail to critically evaluate the outcome at the end." [Sigmund, 2022]
</blockquote>
<blockquote> "Real progress on evaluating design methods can only be expected if preconditions such as standardized theoretical constructs, measures, data bases of empirical data, and a sufficient number of studies on specific design methods are developed." [Hein and Lamé, 2020]</blockquote>
  <blockquote> "Without action to increase scientific, theoretical, and methodological rigour there is a real possibility of the field being superseded and becoming obsolete through lack of impact." [Cash, 2018]</blockquote>
  <blockquote> "There is this concern that design research does not live up to the standards of science: it is creating in a sense too many theories and models, which jeopardises the coherence of the discipline and which indicates that design research does not yet have the means to test and refute design theories and models." [Vermaas, 2014] </blockquote>
  <blockquote> "There is in design research a general concern about the quality of the testing of design theories and models. In work reflecting on the results that design research has produced, it is complained that generally accepted and effective research methods for testing design theories and models are lacking in design research, and that the discipline is fragmented in separate research strands.” [Vermaas, 2014]</blockquote>
  <blockquote> “37% of the articles reviewed did not have any validation. There needs to be more validation in the field of research in engineering design.” [Barth, A. et al. 2011]</blockquote>
  <blockquote> “A lack of common terminology, benchmarked research methods, and above all, a common research methodology are the most outstanding problems in the field.” [Blessing and Chakrabarti, 2009]</blockquote>
