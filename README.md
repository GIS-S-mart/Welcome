# Open Science Benchmarking for Engineering Research

This open science wiki site is a collaborative space that gathers engineering methods and tools resulting from research studies to be benchmarked for providing objective evidences that the community is making progress.

## Motivations

*Why did we start this open science environment for benchmarking engineering research?*

During the last decades, numerous researchers in engineering design have reached a general consensus:
 - "without action to increase scientific, theoretical, and methodological rigour there is a real possibility of the field being superseded and becoming obsolete through lack of impact." [Cash, 2018]
  - "There is this concern that design research does not live up to the standards of science: it is creating in a sense too many theories and models, which jeopardises the coherence of the discipline and which indicates that design research does not yet have the means to test and refute design theories and models." [Vermaas, 2014]
  - "“There is in design research a general concern about the quality of the testing of design theories and models. In work reflecting on the results that design research has produced, it is complained that generally accepted and effective research methods for testing design theories and models are lacking in design research, and that the discipline is fragmented in separate research strands” (Vermaas, 2014)
  - “37% of the articles reviewed did not have any validation. There needs to be more validation in the field of research in engineering design.” [Barth, A. et al. 2011]
  - “A lack of common terminology, benchmarked research methods, and above all, a common research methodology are the most outstanding problems in the field” [Blessing
and Chakrabarti, 2009]
  - “We often observe that PhD students present their work describing what they are doing or planning to do, but fail to state the research questions and hypotheses behind their work. When research questions are formulated, they are often very vague, too encompassing to be answered within one PhD project.” [Blessing & Chakrabarti ,2009]
  - "Real progress on evaluating design methods can only be expected if preconditions such as standardized theoretical construcs, measures, data bases of empirical data, and a sufficient number of studies on specific design methods are developed." [Hein and Lamé, 2020]

## Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines expectations for paticipation in this Open Source Benchmarking Environment for Research Engineering. By joining our community, you pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community by:
- Being radically inclusive to existing members and newcomers looking to learn or participate
- Being totally respectful of each others abilities, interests, viewpoints, experiences and personal differences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism and being exceedingly kind even in moments of disagreement while working towards consensus
- Educating and illuminating others with something you know more about
- Contacting the original contributors before any external communication
- Preventing any public or private business opportunities of the open source content without agreeing with the original authors and contributors of the sources

**People violating this code of conduct may be banned from the community**
