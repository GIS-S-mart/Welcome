# Open Science Benchmarking for Engineering Research

This open science wiki site is a collaborative space that gathers engineering methods and tools resulting from research studies to be benchmarked for providing objective evidences that the community is making progress.

## Motivations

for building confidence in the usefulness of the new knowledge with respect to a purpose

 regrouping empirical data bases, qualitative and quantitative standardized measures for comparing studies, and agreed upon theoretical constructs such as causal graphs 

## Folder organisation
